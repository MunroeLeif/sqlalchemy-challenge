The purpose of this project was to create a Flask app showcasing a weather analysis of Honolulu, Hawaii, to help the user plan a trip there. 

# About
First, I completed a basic climate analysis and data exploration of a sqlite climate database. This consisted both of a Precipitation analysis, looking at the precipitation values for the last yar of the database, as well as a Station analysis, which focused primarily on the temperature observations at the most active weather station for the same time period. 
Secondly, I designed a Flask API to display the analyses. This includes static routes displaying the Precipitation and Station analyses, as well as a list of all stations. It also includes two dynamic routes which take start or start/end date parameters from the user and returns the minimum, maximum and average temperatures collected from all stations in the given date range.
